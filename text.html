    <h1>Photos from our Patients</h1>

    <p>Let's standardized the emails of photos being sent to us.</p>
    <p>Have our PTs and or reps write in the subject line: ATTENTION: MARISSA</p>
    <p><strong>Body of the email should contain:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Name of PT</li>
        <li>DOB</li>
        <li>Concern</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This way, we know exactly who to forward the email, to receive the needed attention.</p>
